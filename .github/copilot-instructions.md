# Copilot Instructions for TimeManagement App
- This is an Expo React Native project using TypeScript.
- Use modular, offline-first patterns for all data storage (AsyncStorage or SQLite abstraction).
- All screens must be accessible, minimalist, and support light/dark mode.
- Use React Navigation for all navigation flows.
- Charts should use react-native-chart-kit or Victory Native.
- Mark premium/paid features with clear comments for future upgrades.
- Abstract storage and business logic for easy cloud sync/auth integration later.
